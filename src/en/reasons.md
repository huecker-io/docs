# Reasons

On the night of 5/30/2024, Docker Hub blocked access for users from Russia. This is due to sanctions imposed on Russia _(as well as Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Republic of Crimea, Sudan and Syria)_.

The restriction affected a huge number of users, so it was decided to create a Docker Hub mirror available for developers from restricted regions.

## Error text

```
403 Forbidden

Since Docker is a US company, we must comply with US export control regulations.
In an effort to comply with these, we now block all IP addresses that are located in Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Republic of Crimea, Sudan, and Syria.
If you are not in one of these cities, countries, or regions and are blocked, please reach out to https://hub.docker.com/support/contact/
